The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant. Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish.

You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! I hate yogurt. __It's just stuff with bits in.__ *You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas?* Saving the world with meals on wheels.

## They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens!

Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish. All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong? It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool.

1. It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool.
2. You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better?
3. No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister.

### *Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do!

Saving the world with meals on wheels. You've swallowed a planet! Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! Did I mention we have comfy chairs?

* Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush.
* I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks!

You've swallowed a planet! You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better? I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself.

You hit me with a cricket bat. You hit me with a cricket bat. You've swallowed a planet! Saving the world with meals on wheels. Saving the world with meals on wheels.

Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish. It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool.

Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush. It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you?

Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? You've swallowed a planet! Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time!

I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'!
